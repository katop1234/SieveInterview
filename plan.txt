1. use cnn to identify all person objects in the frames

2. get neural network embeddings for the blue jersey + red jersey + referee
object frames

3. for each frame, label the five closest frames to each of the above (using
euclidean distance) to that entity. for referee, just set a threshold based
on trial and error. You may have to do some manual labelling to get the
desired frames and see what embeddings they generate.

4. add functionality to do the above, and then get the relevant json / labels of
the model at each frame with that.

### copied from my main.py file to make it cleaner
# have a helper function that can pull up the person object's frame for a target
# frame to make manual classification easier.

# manually parse through some of the frames for each desired category and get
# their embedding. store these somewhere as reference

# go through each person objects recognized and calculate the sum euclidean
# distance to each of the desired categories, and pick the top n of each to
# classify as being the that type. also have a way to store the objects in a
# json for each frame, should be given to you in the setup for the models.2
