1. use cnn to identify all person objects in the frames

2. get neural network embeddings for the blue jersey + red jersey + referee
object frames

3. for each frame, label the five closest frames to each of the above (using
euclidean distance) to that entity. for referee, just set a threshold based
on trial and error. You may have to do some manual labelling to get the
desired frames and see what embeddings they generate.

4. add functionality to do the above, and then get the relevant json / labels of
the model at each frame with that.

### ONLY TO DO
find the best center vector for each class. assign negative weights for other
clusters the k means cluster detects (like the dakr blue shirt) to improve
performance. this will be tedious and likely require looking over many different
frames and find the optimal threshold that way.

notes on output:
0 - mixed
1 - white players in audience
2 - audience
3 - dark / light blue in audience
4 - mixed
5 - mixed or more blue
6 - trash
7 - mixed
8 - BLUE
9 - dark blue in audience
10 - REFS
11 - light blue in audience
12 - WHITE
13 - mixed
14 - mixed but more white
15 - REFS
16 - trash
17 - audience / trash
18 - REFS but not as good
19 - REFS but not as good also

9/29 --
sheesh, the k means classifier failed miserably. Moving to a mask solution that i listed in my original proposal
in the home stretch!
